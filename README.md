Performance Metrics
With CDN:

<img width="1425" height="896" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-27 221008" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b220825-61f8-4633-8680-0c50c1b29bc1" />

Without CDN (I uploaded to Infinity Free at first but found out they had no CDN):
<img width="1342" height="892" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-27 204754" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80860026-877f-4297-b206-8f57b6075a3f" />

<img width="1415" height="874" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-27 202434" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dfab09d-21dd-4932-88c8-84ae32e43a48" />

As you can see there is higher performance with CDN (Netlify), than without CDN (Infinty Free).

Accessibility and SEO Strategies:
- alt tags were used
- ARIA labels were used
- Semantic HTML was used
- robots.txt and sitemap.xml were created
